# CPP-Learning-Notes
C++ learning notes: Lessons from basic to advanced, code examples, and explanations.

## üìö What You'll Find Here
This repository contains C++ code examples with **very simple English comments** to help beginners understand programming concepts step by step.

## üöÄ How to Use This Repository

### 1. Basic Concepts (Start Here!)
Navigate to the `01-basics/` folder to learn fundamental C++ concepts:

- **01-hello-world.cpp** - Your first C++ program
- **02-variables.cpp** - Learn about storing data (numbers, text, true/false)
- **03-input-output.cpp** - Get input from users and show output
- **04-arithmetic.cpp** - Basic math operations (+, -, *, /, %)
- **05-if-else.cpp** - Making decisions in your program
- **06-loops.cpp** - Repeating actions (for loops, while loops)
- **07-functions.cpp** - Creating reusable pieces of code

### 2. Intermediate Concepts
Once you're comfortable with basics, explore the `02-intermediate/` folder:

- **01-arrays.cpp** - Storing multiple values in one container
- **02-structs.cpp** - Grouping related data together
- **03-calculator.cpp** - A complete calculator program (combines many concepts!)

## üíª How to Run the Code

### Option 1: Online (Easiest)
Copy the code and run it on online C++ compilers like:
- [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler)
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/)

### Option 2: On Your Computer
If you have a C++ compiler installed:

```bash
# Navigate to the folder containing the file
cd 01-basics

# Compile the program (replace filename with the actual file)
g++ 01-hello-world.cpp -o hello

# Run the program
./hello
```

## üéØ Learning Tips

1. **Start with the basics** - Don't skip ahead! Each concept builds on the previous one.
2. **Read the comments** - Every line has simple explanations in plain English.
3. **Try changing things** - Modify the numbers, text, or conditions to see what happens.
4. **Run each program** - Don't just read the code, actually run it to see the output.
5. **Experiment** - Once you understand a concept, try creating your own examples.

## ü§ù Need Help?
- Each file has detailed comments explaining what every line does
- Start with simpler programs and work your way up
- Try running the code and see what happens!

Happy coding! üéâ
